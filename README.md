# Arpasing-Oto-Organiser
seperates different phoneme combinations to make setting values and general otoing easier
so far made entirely by my friend psychic digit.

to use, download "aorta_nogui_6-17-23.zip" and extract it.
then place an oto.ini file into the directory and run "aorta_nogui.exe"
follow the prompt and look into "oto_split" to see the created files. then you are free to edit the parameters as you need, then place back into a singular oto.ini file using cntr c and cntr v.
the program will not work if you have a suffix or use phonemes in the file names, (i.e ao_er_ey_aa_ih.wav=ao erG4,583,120,1918,110,100) but will work with a prefix and uses numbers (i.e 000.wav=g3- ay,585.699,530.163,4065.301,240,80)

there are plans to add a gui at a later time (hence the nogui in the file name)
